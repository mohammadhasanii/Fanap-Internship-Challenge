# Fanap Internship Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the Fanap software engineering internship coding challenge. The solutions for all five mandatory problems are included.

Project Link: `https://github.com/mohammadhasanii/Fanap-Internship-Challenge`

---

## Project Structure

-   `solutions.py`: Contains all the functions that solve the challenge problems.
-   `main.py`: A script to run all the functions and print their outputs to demonstrate they work correctly.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohammadhasanii/Fanap-Internship-Challenge.git
```


## How to Run

To see the output for all implemented solutions, run the `main.py` script. This script acts as a demonstration for each function.

```bash
python3 main.py
or
py main.py
```

## My Approach

I've tried to keep the solutions simple and straightforward, focusing on clean and readable code. I'm aware that Python has many advanced tricks and libraries, but I chose a more fundamental approach for this challenge.

Regarding testing, the challenge PDF mentioned that no advanced tools are needed. While I regularly use frameworks like `pytest` for unit testing, I interpreted that guideline as a request to stick to the core language features. Therefore, I've used the `main.py` file to clearly demonstrate the correctness of each function with sample inputs, rather than adding an external testing library.
